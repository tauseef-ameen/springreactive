# springreactive
This is Simple spring reactive application which return a resource (id and Name) every 1 second.
I have created 2 end points. one is traditional/old/synchronous way while other is reactiveway/asynchronous/reactive programming.
Endpoints are : http://localhost:8081/baeldung/oldway  AND http://localhost:8081/baeldung/reactiveway. By running both end points user will get to know difference between synchronous and reactive programming. Both are simple GET end point. No need to pass anything, just run endpoint in your browser.
Application will start on port 8081
